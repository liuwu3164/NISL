Haixin Duan started his research on network security in 1994, when he was a master student. After he got his Ph.D degree in Computer Science in Tsinghua University, 2000, he became a faculty in Network Research Center of Tsinghua University. Professor Duan has two classes on network security for both graduate and undergraduate students, and is the leader of CCERT( CERNET(Chinese Education and Research Network) Computer Emergency Response Team). During 2011~2013, professor Duan was a visiting researcher in UC Berkeley and worked in ICSI(International Computer Science Institute) as a senior scientist. His research interests include security Internet infrastructure( such as DNS, BGP, Web and PKI), IDS and etc..
